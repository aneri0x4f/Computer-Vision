## Aliasing
### Meaning 1
Aliasing is the visual stair-stepping of edges that occurs in an image when the resolution is too low. Anti-aliasing is the smoothing of jagged edges in digital images by averaging the colors of the pixels at a boundary

## Homogeneous coordinate system
Why do we need homogeneous coordinate system for transformation?
homogeneous coordinates also allows to represent infinity: (x,y,z,0)=x,y,z0 in 3D, i.e., the point at infinity in direction x,y,z. Typically, light sources at finite or infinite position can be represented the same way.

## Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function BRDF
The most general model of light scattering is the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). Relative to some local coordinate frame on the surface, the BRDF is a four dimensional function that describes how much of each wavelength arriving at an incident direction is emitted in a reflected direction.
