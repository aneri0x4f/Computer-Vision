## Homogeneous coordinate system
Why do we need homogeneous coordinate system for transformation?
homogeneous coordinates also allows to represent infinity: (x,y,z,0)=x,y,z0 in 3D, i.e., the point at infinity in direction x,y,z. Typically, light sources at finite or infinite position can be represented the same way.
